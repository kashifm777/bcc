# BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION  
The aim of this project is to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign using the dataset from sckit-learn.  

The app analyzes the given data and provides prediction accuracy for the various classification algorithms.  

* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Random Forest
* Decision Trees
* Na√Øve Bayes

The application allows for interactivity with the parameters of these classification algorithms. In addition, We have plot Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall Curve and ROC curve for each of the classifications.
